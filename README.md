# Playlist Tracker App

The Playlist Tracker App is a web application that allows users to search for songs using the Spotify API, create playlists, and save their favorite tracks to those playlists.

## Features

- Add to Playlist: Users can add their favorite tracks to a temporary playlist displayed on the page.
- Save Playlist: Users can save their temporary playlist by giving it a name. The saved playlists are then accessible for future viewing.
- View All Playlists: Users can view all the saved playlists along with the tracks added to each playlist.
- Delete from Playlist: Users can remove tracks from their temporary playlist or from a saved playlist.
